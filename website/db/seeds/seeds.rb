Venture.create({"name"=>"350 Seattle", "description"=>"Mission\n350 Seattle works toward climate justice by organizing people to make deep system change: resisting fossil fuels; building momentum for healthy alternatives; and fostering resilient, just, and welcoming communities.\n\nShared Values\nTo understand more about our values, and how they interact with our mission, it might be useful to look at our statement on what we think are false, complicated, and not-ready-for-prime-time solutions.\n\nPrinciple 1: Climate change is a profound and urgent threat to all life on the planet–but most especially and most immediately to those in the Global South.\n\nClimate change is already wreaking havoc in the Global South, and in vulnerable communities everywhere: those that are low-income, indigenous, and/or communities of color. We will take guidance from those on the frontlines of extreme weather and sea-level rise, as well as those on the frontlines of fossil fuel extraction, and support their fight for immediate and aggressive action on climate.\n\nPrinciple 2: Our economic system and its dependence on cheap fossil fuels have caused the devastation of communities and ecosystems; as US residents, we’ve been complicit in this, and we’ve benefited from it; we therefore have a responsibility to act.\n\nPrivilege allows many of us to take legal and political risks that would be life-threatening in many countries, and we have greater ability to change the systems causing the devastation. We feel morally compelled to do all we can–including utilizing peaceful civil disobedience when necessary–and believe that building a people’s movement is the most powerful way to catalyze ambitious and just climate policies.\n\nPrinciple 3: We believe in a just transition.\n\nFossil fuel industry workers have labored in dangerous and unhealthful conditions for decades. We support their demands for accessible family-wage jobs in the transition to clean renewables, and we will collaborate with them whenever possible, except where this collaboration would be in direct conflict with Principle 1. We also recognize the long history of environmental injustices perpetrated on communities of color and low-income communities, and will accept no “solutions” that fail to protect these communities.\n\nPrinciple 4: We believe in our collective power.\n\nClimate change is not a problem of human nature; it’s a problem of very specific systems that we can choose to change, and a problem created by the companies that lied to us for decades about the risks. The Pacific Northwest has been extraordinarily powerful in defeating proposed fossil fuel projects; it took all of us, working at every level. Some people find it easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of fossil fuel dependence, but with your help, we can change that, remind people of their power, and help show the world what the fight for climate justice looks like.

Venture.create({"name"=>"American Prairie Reserve", "description"=>"# History\n\nSince the 19th century, a variety of efforts have been undertaken to ensure that America’s Great Plains remains intact for future generations.\n\nIn 1999, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) published Ecoregional Planning in the Northern Great Plains Steppe, which, for the first time, pinpointed specific, critical areas of the Northern Great Plains that were the most viable for conserving the existing diversity of plants and animals. The region just north of the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge in northeastern Montana was identified as a top priority for grassland conservation, owing to the relatively pristine condition of the land and the diversity of wildlife species in the area.\n\nShortly after TNC published its findings, World Wildlife Fund decided to initiate a conservation effort in the Montana Glaciated Plains, one of the key areas identified by TNC. They determined that an independent entity, capable of focusing all of its time and resources on the preservation of Montana's Northern Great Plains, would be the best vehicle through which to initiate a large-scale conservation effort. In June 2001, The Prairie Foundation was officially formed as an independent non-profit organization, later named American Prairie Foundation, then American Prairie Reserve, and now known as American Prairie. World Wildlife Fund's Northern Great Plains Program was an active and valued science contributor to American Prairie during its first decade. Specifically, WWF provided on-the-ground scientific support conducting inventories (plants, streams, birds and wildlife) and wildlife migration studies, monitoring and protecting prairie dogs, reintroducing bison, restoring streams and riparian areas.\n\nToday, American Prairie is a freestanding Montana-based nonprofit that started to assemble land in 2004. Our main focus is to purchase and permanently hold title to private lands that glue together a vast mosaic of existing public lands so that the region is managed thoughtfully and collaboratively with state and federal agencies for wildlife conservation and public access.\n\nThe idea of preserving a unique area of the American prairie, to be enjoyed forever and by all walks of life, has been worked on diligently, and in a variety of ways, for well over one hundred years. At American Prairie, we view our work as continuing the legacy of a long line of talented people and committed organizations as well as honoring a landscape that has helped shaped the vitality and character of our country. \n\n[Meet our current staff and Board of Directors](https://www.americanprairie.org/leadership).", "logo"=>"", "org_size"=>nil, "year_started"=>nil, "status"=>"Unclaimed", "labels"=>"conservation; prairie; restoration;", "cover_photo"=>"https://www.americanprairie.org/sites/default/files/public%3A/footer_bg_img.jpg", "summary"=>"Help us protect the prairie today", "link"=>"https://www.americanprairie.org/", "discord"=>"", "youtube"=>"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kas2WEMyino"})
